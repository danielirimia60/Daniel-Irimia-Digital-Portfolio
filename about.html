                    Daniel Tiberiu Irimia is a college student passionate about technology and its many impressive achievements. In particular he likes programming, being the object of study for him at Darlington College but also a topic he researches by himself in his own time. Born in Romania and raised in Italy he now lives, works and studies in Darlington UK.

                    Daniel's love for technology goes back many years when he started having an increased interest in building custom computer systems and desktop setups. Although his love for hardware and its many applications is still high, he also discovered the wonderful world of software and how web applications and websites are being created, giving him a new way to follow in the world of technology. Because of this, he also developed a liking for web design, creating UX/UI designs for some of his projects but also a multitude of other assets such as wallpapers or logos.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Daniel has many hobbies such as traveling, bike riding - which is also his preferred way of getting to work, building and designing custom PCs and desktop setups, chess, gaming - being an active League of Legends, World of Warcraft and Apex Legends player but also enjoys older, more nostalgia inducing titles such as GTA, Counter Strike, Half Life or some RTS titles. He also likes astronomy <span>(not to be confused with astrology which he finds to be a rather funny topic)</span>, being inspired to study this subject and to make astronomical observations for over a decade in which he discovered the wonderful secrets of the universe.
